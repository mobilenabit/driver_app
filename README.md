# driver_app

A new Flutter project.

## Requirements

- A working copy of Flutter SDK and Android SDK (for Android builds).
- Xcode (for iOS builds).
- (optional, but recommended) [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner. You will need to run the full commands by yourself if you don't use `just`, so it's highly recommended.
